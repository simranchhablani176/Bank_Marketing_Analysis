# Bank_Marketing_Analysis
# The assignment was to managing data preparation. Visualizations and computed metrics, such as bar graphs and aggregated success rates, that showed which features linked most strongly with the variable, "y" (term deposit subscription), made up the majority of the output.  Actionable insights for improving future marketing strategies were provided by specific analytical outputs, which revealed that subscription rates were highest among students and retirees, varied significantly by the month and day_of_week of the last contact, and were strongly predicted by the previous campaign outcome.
